Lisa is from Evansville, Indiana, where she was a Suzuki violin student. She has been a member of various orchestras there and in her subsequent travels. She moved to Nashville and worked as an engineer at the Saturn Car Company. Her coworkers had a band and needed a fiddle player. So she learned some Bluegrass and country music on the fiddle. While in Nashville she worked with up and coming singer songwriter Jamie Spencer in various venues. A move to Ann Arbor brought her into the group Bill Bynum & Co. Bynum, a superb songwriter/performer, gave her an opportunity to plumb bluegrass, folk, and alt country. It also showcased her vocal talent. Now she's in Madison and returning to music after raising her daughter to a pre-school age. It's SpareTime's luck that she's joining with us to bring new harmonies, and a bit of Alison Krauss and Kenny Baker.

To contact them please see the “Contact us” page.\n\nSpareTime continues and welcomes bass player Lorie Docken to the band. She has been the “back-up” bassist for 2 years and takes over the job full-time (well part-time since we are only SpareTime).\n\nOther musician friends are gracing us with their presence on the stage. This adds new songs to the repertoire with different voices and instruments.\n\nThe Labor Day weekend gig at the Roxbury Tavern featured Jim and Laura Lotridge and young Dane . Jim and Laura play with Kevin Tubb and the Welldiggers and also with the perennial local bluegrass band, Pat Downings' Down from the Hills.\n\nThe September Hody Bar gig featured mandolin and tenor singer Dale Ward . Dale regularly practices and plays with Jefferson County .\n\nThe October Hody Bar gig includes Madison bluegrass all-stars George Diak on mandolin and Scott Shank on Dobro.

The Event, held at the Barrymore, will take place at 1:00 p.m. on February 13th. Since the initial concert, SpareTime has had the pleasure of inviting other area groups and individuals to be part of the music and join in the benefit concert that benefits the local efforts of United Way in assisting area residents. This year the lineup includes Dave Landau with his popular show for children at 1:00 p.m. Dave is a consistent winner in the Best of Madison for Children's Entertainer, but, more than that, a consistent favorite with youngsters. The Cork 'n Bottle String Band is also on the bill. The Corks have been Madison bluegrass favorite for decades. Their tenure at Ken's Bar, the Memorial Union, and other venues has led to the formation of a loyal band of Corkheads eager to listen and watch the Cork 'n Bottle in action. Think of solid musicianship and great tunes. If you ever wondered what a bluegrass Marx Brothers band would be like, come to the Barrymore. The Oak Street Ramblers are again a group taking a part in the concert. the Ramblers have been a mainstay at the Alchemy and the Malt House for several years. This is a relatively young bluegrass band, but one that has been gaining in popularity for some time. Prepare yourself for beautiful harmonies and solid instrumentals. The group is currently mixing its first album. Come out and get a preview of the songs. SpareTime Bluegrass Band has been involved in all ten concerts. The two-time Madison Area Music Award winners have hosted the event. The group is equally adept at traditional bluegrass and material and sources as diverse as the Beatles, George Jones, and Blind Faith. The cost of the kid friendly concert is $10.00 for adults, $5.00 for children over five years of age. Children under five are free. The cost for a family is $20.00 (or the above cost, whichever is lower). The Barrymore Theater always had great snacks and beverages, and has welcomed this concert with open arms. Come out for an afternoon of fun.\n",

It veered back to more bluegrass than the last CD’s, but did include a George Harrison tune \"If I Needed Someone\". Bobby managed to get a picture of his grandparents on the front of the CD. We staged the CD release at the Roxbury Tavern and managed to have some members of Monroe Crossing in the audience. They had done a show nearly next door at the Dorf House, and for an afternoon, Roxbury was the epicenter of the bluegrass world in Wisconsin. The CD was well received there and elsewhere and we thank those who purchased it or listened to us do the whole thing (all the words and all the chords in place) in Roxbury. Brooklyn Fest was in June. We were very honored to play, had a great time, and heard some great music. The festival is in a great venue and the area residents are welcoming and open. We really hope this builds and builds. Our part of the show was recorded and broadcast on WI Public Radio’s Simply Folk on Dec. 5th. The Southern Wisconsin Bluegrass Association asked us to play at the Edgerton Thresheree in September. We had never seen one of these. There was a flea market and a parade of older farm machinery (including some steam powered machines). Everything looked really large, sounded really loud, and seemed really dangerous. If farmers needed to use these machines to grow crops, I hope they got every penny they deserved when they sold the harvest. Weddings were a high spot in the SpareTime recent memory. We played the Tyranena Brewery and had two couples in the audience whose wedding we had played for the year before. It was great to see this marriage thing is not just a passing and everyone was still married. One of the weddings was the first time we had done \"If I Needed Someone\", which we did at the brewery. The other featured a rendition of \"The Proudest Monkey\", a Dave Matthews song that we didn't do. We did another wedding in the fall where another Beatles' tune, \"In My Life\", was tapped for the processional. That wedding was at the Badger Farms, a beautiful converted barn on a working farm in Dane County. The highlight of songs-brides-and-grooms-wanted-us-to-play-at-their-wedding was at our first Jewish wedding. The couple asked for \"Deep Elem Blues\", a song about an \"adult entertainment\" area in 1880's Dallas. They also wanted a Beatles' tune \"Two of Us\" (off the \"Let it Be\" album). We did those---but they also wanted Hava Nagila. Never having played a Jewish folksong, we had to go back to the chords and crank out a reputable version of the tune. Luckily Paul Kienitz was playing fiddle with us and we came up with a version that sounded a bit Kletzmer and a bit bluegrass. This extended Kletz-Grass dance version of Hava Nagila was the basis for clapping, singing, and the traditional ride by the bride and groom on chairs held high. We were very pleased to be a part of it all. In the coming months SpareTime has several things on tap. We will be doing the traditional \"Geezers New Years\" at the Roxbury Tavern. This event has become a Wisconsin tradition, albeit and odd one. We play from 7 to 9 in the evening and the Tavern closes at 10. It's Midnight somewhere. This year the event is also a benefit. For information about tickets please contact the Roxbury Tavern. February 13, 2011 will be our annual Bluegrass Benefit for the United Way. This is the 10th anniversary and we are happy to have been a part of it all from the beginning. The usual suspects will be there (Cork and Bottle, Oak Street Ramblers, and special guests). We hope you will be with us. SpareTime is looking forward to the Madison Area Music Awards (MAMAs) in the spring. The album has been nominated for country CD of the year. Remember the Chicago election mantra---vote early and often. Thanks to all of you for your continued support. We hope to see you in the future......\n",

The Southern Wisconsin Bluegrass Association asked us to play at the Edgerton Thresheree in September. We had never seen one of these. There was a flea market and a parade of older farm machinery (including some steam powered machines). Everything looked really large, sounded really loud, and seemed really dangerous. If farmers needed to use these machines to grow crops, I hope they got every penny they deserved when they sold the harvest. Weddings were a high spot in the SpareTime recent memory. We played the Tyranena Brewery and had two couples in the audience whose wedding we had played for the year before. It was great to see this marriage thing is not just a passing and everyone was still married. One of the weddings was the first time we had done \"If I Needed Someone\", which we did at the brewery. The other featured a rendition of \"The Proudest Monkey\", a Dave Matthews song that we didn't do. We did another wedding in the fall where another Beatles' tune, \"In My Life\", was tapped for the processional. That wedding was at the Badger Farms, a beautiful converted barn on a working farm in Dane County. The highlight of songs-brides-and-grooms-wanted-us-to-play-at-their-wedding was at our first Jewish wedding. The couple asked for \"Deep Elem Blues\", a song about an \"adult entertainment\" area in 1880's Dallas. They also wanted a Beatles' tune \"Two of Us\" (off the \"Let it Be\" album). We did those---but they also wanted Hava Nagila. Never having played a Jewish folksong, we had to go back to the chords and crank out a reputable version of the tune. Luckily Paul Kienitz was playing fiddle with us and we came up with a version that sounded a bit Kletzmer and a bit bluegrass. This extended Kletz-Grass dance version of Hava Nagila was the basis for clapping, singing, and the traditional ride by the bride and groom on chairs held high. We were very pleased to be a part of it all. In the coming months SpareTime has several things on tap. We will be doing the traditional \"Geezers New Years\" at the Roxbury Tavern. This event has become a Wisconsin tradition, albeit and odd one. We play from 7 to 9 in the evening and the Tavern closes at 10. It's Midnight somewhere. This year the event is also a benefit. For information about tickets please contact the Roxbury Tavern. February 13, 2011 will be our annual Bluegrass Benefit for the United Way. This is the 10th anniversary and we are happy to have been a part of it all from the beginning. The usual suspects will be there (Cork and Bottle, Oak Street Ramblers, and special guests). We hope you will be with us. SpareTime is looking forward to the Madison Area Music Awards (MAMAs) in the spring. The album has been nominated for country CD of the year. Remember the Chicago election mantra---vote early and often. Thanks to all of you for your continued support. We hope to see you in the future……</p>"
