SpareTime has a guest fiddler. Lisa Case Doro will be singing and playing with the boys (& Lorie). Lisa is from Evansville, Indiana, where she was a Suzuki violin student. She has been a member of various orchestras there and in her subsequent travels. She moved to Nashville and worked as an engineer at the Saturn Car Company. Her coworkers had a band and needed a fiddle player. So she learned some Bluegrass and country music on the fiddle. While in Nashville she worked with up and coming singer songwriter Jamie Spencer in various venues. A move to Ann Arbor brought her into the group Bill Bynum & Co. Bynum, a superb songwriter/performer, gave her an opportunity to plumb bluegrass, folk, and alt country. It also showcased her vocal talent. Now she's in Madison and returning to music after raising her daughter to a pre-school age. It's SpareTime's luck that she's joining with us to bring new harmonies, and a bit of Alison Krauss and Kenny Baker. Come hear and meet her with us at Boo Grass at the High Noon Saloon on Oct 29th or at the Roxbury Tavern on Oct 30th.
