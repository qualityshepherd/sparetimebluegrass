The SpareTime Bluegrass Band is headlining the 6th annual United Way benefit concert on Sunday, February 11th. During the afternoon, they will be turning the stage over to the always energetic Lonesome Rogues, and the perrenial masters of entertainment and surprise, The Cork ‘n’ Bottle String Band.

The attached PDF poster gives the details about time, price and the Barrymore’s address, so don’t miss this chance to lend support to those in our community who could use a helping hand. It’s a great way to spend a cold Sunday getting a warm feeling and sharing the day with our great and generous local bluegrass musicians.

Hope to see y’all there.
