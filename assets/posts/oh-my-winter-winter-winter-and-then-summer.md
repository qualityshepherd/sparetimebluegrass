We made it thru April and in May start playing outside gigs. Lisa is with us till mid June when she has asked for some time off. Till then we are playing all we can. So see us in the next weeks at Tyranena, Whole Foods, Capital Brewery and the Memorial Union Terrace with a mid summer appearance at the nearly historic Roxbury Tavern. Stop and have a beer or a cherry coke with the band. Cheers.
