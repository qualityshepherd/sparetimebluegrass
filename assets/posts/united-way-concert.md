Hello All, SpareTime is proud to announce the 9th Annual United Way Bluegrass Concert. The event is on Sunday, February 14th at the Barrymore, starting at 1:00 p.m. We've been lucky enough to have been involved in this event since its inception. We've invited other bands to share the stage and bring out the bluegrass community in an effort to assist the United Way in bringing its many services to the community. This year the family friendly event features Dave Laundau, Cork 'N Bottle String Band, The Oak Street Rambler, and SpareTime. The ticket prices remain unchanged at $10 for adults, $5 for children, or $20 for families. The concert is a great afternoon of local bluegrass and a fun way to spend a Sunday afternoon. We hope to see you there.
