SpareTime is prepping for a busy summer. So busy, we will be taking off the 3rd Thursdays at the Frequency till August. So stop by on May 17th for our last Frequency appearance until the end of the summer. See you there or see us at the Capital Brewery, Memorial Union Terrace, Whole Foods or the Tyranena Brewery this summer.
