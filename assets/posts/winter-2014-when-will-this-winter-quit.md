Cold and more cold. it must be time for some hot Bluegrass. SpareTime continues to play at the Frequency on the 3rd Thursdays of the month from 6 to 8. $5 or 3 cans of food for the WilMar foodbank.

We are playing for the big United Way Bluegrass Benefit at the Barrymore Theatre on Sunday Feb. 9. A full afternoon of bluegrass for $10. Please stop out to support this good cause.

February also brings studio time for SpareTime at Audio for the Arts. We hope to have a new CD out with Lisa singing and fiddling by this summer.

March brings our St Patrick's gig at the legendary Roxbury Tavern. We are playing on Sunday to give us all Monday to chase the snakes out.

April SpareTime is playing for the Ladies of Bluegrass 7th Annual Music Festival at Watering Hole 2017 Velp Ave, Greenbay, Wisc.

& then comes Summer
