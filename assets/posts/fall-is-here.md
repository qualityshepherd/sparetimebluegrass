Hello Fall, Summer just blew past us all. Lisa was out on Maternity Leave and now she is back. We have some shows lined up for the fall but we have been spending most of our energy on the new CD. The CD titled Vauxhall (after Jim's first car) is in final prep and will be ready for the Xmas gift-giving season. We like it and hope you will too. It is our first CD with Lisa singing and playing. Steve Gotcher from Audio for the Arts is again doing the recording and mixing. Winter is coming on and that is wood shed din' time when we learn some new tunes. Send me a note if you got a tune SpareTime ought to be doing. So come out and see us when you can. I will try and keep the calendar up to date. We look forward to a milder winter than last year and some of your faces at our gigs. Peace out BB
