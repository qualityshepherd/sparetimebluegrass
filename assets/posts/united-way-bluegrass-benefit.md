**ALTERNATIVE FACTS FROM SPARETIME**

Life has been wonderful for the multinational conglomerate that is The Sparetime Bluegrass Band. We’ve been breaking records wherever we’ve played. The CDs have all gone platinum (we gold plate everything in our lives), and we only play the best instruments……We’re serious.

On Sunday February 12th we will be taking part in United Way Bluegrass Benefit at the Barrymore Theater in Madison. We were, of course, the first band to do it way back when. We were actually the only band at the first one. The audience at that first one was enormous…you probably remember newspaper stories about gridlock after the event.

This year the crowd estimate is about 80,000 to 100,000, making it the largest benefit concert anywhere in the Mid-West. We’re happy, in our own large way, to be a part of this.
 

**THE OTHER FACTS**

Actually there is a benefit concert at the Barrymore on February 12. We are a part of it. We did do the first one and were the only band. We are always proud to be a part of the concert. The event is a wonderful family friendly concert. It gives the kids a chance to see Dave Landau in concert and a chance for everyone to see strong local bluegrass musicians get together to assist the United Way.

The doors open at Noon and events run until about 6:00 p.m. We would love to have you all there.
