SpareTime has been involved with a couple of events linked to the recent and continuing political fight at the Capitol in Madison.  We were involved in the "Pickers Local 608" YouTube rendition of "There is Power in the Union".  This featured a large group of local players at Audio for the Arts studio playing in support of union rights.

We also performed on April 3rd at the Barrymore for the Forward Wisconsin Fest put on by the Stagehands IATSE local 251.  It was a diverse day of music and fun that also signaled our support for good and sane government in Wisconsin.

On a lighter note---SpareTime is going "Up Nort" with a swing through the Upper Penninsula and Northern Wisconsin in June.  On June 23rd we will be in Iron Mountain, Michigan for their Off the Square series of concerts.  The performance will be downtown and start at 11:30 a.m.  We have been there four times and always have a great time.

On June 24th we will be a few miles down the road in Florence, Wisconsin for an evening performance.  This is the second time we have played there and the performance starts in the evening on the main road.

Saturday June 25th we will play at the revived Flatrock Bluegrass Festival, this year held at Thorntons Resort & Rafting Company in Crivitz, Wisconsin.  We've lost count of our number of appearances at the festival.  We always love the audience.  It gives us a chance to hook up with old friends, in a friendly locale.

We have been and will continue to play at the Frequency (121 W. Main St. Madison) from 6 to 8 p.m. every 3rd Thursday of the month.  As part of the gig we try to feature great local talent during our break.  We have shared the stage with "Off the Porch" a trio of fine women singers (they definitely have voice).  April will see the Northern Pikers String Band bring their bluegrass to the stage.  May brings talent originally from Michigan.  Bill Bynum & Company will perform.

The Frequency is definitely a great place to see music.  The sound is good.  The concert is early enough on a work night.  We love playing there.

A word about the Madison Area Music Awards (MAMA).  We have won awards and 2007 and 2008.  This year we are in the final rounds in three categories---Best County/Bluegrass CD of the year, Best Ensemble Vocals, and Cover Song (for our version of George Harrison's "If I Needed Someone").  The nominations are due to our "Someone to Love" CD, released earlier this year.

You can visit the Madison Area Music Association at   themamas.org  for information on the MAMA and how to vote.  Any money generated goes to the purchase and placement of musical instruments into the schools and the hands of school children.  The whole thing gives the local music scene and opportunity to keep the music going and getting young people involved.

See you down the road.
