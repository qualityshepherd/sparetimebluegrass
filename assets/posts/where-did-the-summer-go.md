Here we are seeing the first of the fall weather. Thoughts of the summer gigs are still with us and thanks to all who came out. We are working on learning some new tunes, reworking some old tunes and getting back into the studio for the 1st SpareTime Bluegrass CD with Lisa. Keep an eye open for us and we'll be watching for you. See you soon.
