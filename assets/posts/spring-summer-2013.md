Where does the time go?  Here we are looking at the Spring and Summer gigs for SpareTime.  They include stops at Capital Brewery, Whole Foods, The Frequency, The Roxbury Tavern and a visit to Portage with other dates still being booked.  We are hard at work on a new CD that will have some original instrumentals, classic bluegrass and of course SpareTime's versions of tunes you have heard before.  We are pleased to include Lisa Case-Doro on the CD and in the SpareTime line-up. Having Lisa & Lorie in the band has lowered the average age and improved the appearance of the band.

We are still "havin' a good time".  Stop by and see us when you can.
