It is here. The new SpareTime CD is out. Vauxhall. Our 9th recording and 1st with fiddler/singer Lisa Case Doro is dedicated to all of the musicians who have played as members of SpareTime or been SpareParts for a gig. Thanks to Steve Gotcher at Audio for the Arts for his great recording/mixing and mastering and to Allyson Casey for the CD cover design. Thanks also to the venues we have played these 20 years of SpareTime and to the many fans who have come out and supported the music.
