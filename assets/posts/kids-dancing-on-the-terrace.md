![image](assets/images/IMG_8776.jpg) On June 9th SpareTime played the newly reopened Memorial Union Terrace. The weather was great, as were the sound people from the Union. There is nothing like playing on a stage, the backdrop of which, is Lake Mendota. The Terrace has been redone and better than ever. Also present were a number of children who seemed to be dancing the afternoon away.
