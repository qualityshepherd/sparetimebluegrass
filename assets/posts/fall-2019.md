**Well hello,**

**Here we are wrapped up in fall with much cooler weather.** **SpareTime had fewer summer time gigs this year but made up for it with a full schedule in Sept/Oct from Sun Prairie to Lake Mills to Middleton and Madison.**

**And what a gathering we had with the Roxbury Tavern Reunion.**

**We are singing the Buck Owens tune "Hello Trouble".** **Just take one good look at that group and "here comes trouble that I'm never gonna see since you been away"** **Thanks to Tom and all the Roxburians.**

**Great to see everyone and we are announcing that The Geezers New Years Eve party will be at the Common Ground this year.** **keep an eye here and we'll let you know when tickets are on sale.**

**Hope to see you soon.**

**BB**
