Hi All,

We had a great time at the Roxbury Tavern on Dec. 6th and played a surprise gig at the Frequency in Madison on Dec. 17th.  Our X mas songs were a big hit and Lorie thinks we should do a holiday CD.  So we need some holiday songs you’d like to hear done by SpareTime.

We have 3 songs so far:

- Please, Daddy don’t get drunk this Christmas
- Angels we have heard on high (instrumental)
- Merry X-mas from the Family

What holiday songs would you like?  Add your comments below and we hope to have a CD ready for the Holidays 2010.

Thanks…..SpareTime Bluegrass
