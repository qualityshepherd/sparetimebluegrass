Schumacher Farm, just east of Waunakee, held Spring Bluegrass, its first bluegrass festival on May 14th. Truman’s Ridge, Northern Comfort, Milkhouse Radio, Kristy Larson's Honky Tonk Trio, RF Kieffer, Down from the Hills, Soggy Prairie Boys, and SpareTime were on the bill.

We had a great time despite the exceedingly cold weather. The audience was warm and inviting, and the adaptability of all the groups to the conditions was marvelous. SpareTime has high hopes for the continuing festival. It’s in a great location, with fine facilities. We really need something like this in the area and want next year to be better than ever.

The next few weeks for SpareTime are filled with good events. We play Whole Foods on June 2nd, and journey to Tyranena Brewery in Lake Mills on Friday, June 3rd. This is always a good time. We get to see fans farther east from Madison and play outdoors in a relaxed garden setting. On June 9th we will be outside at the UW Memorial Union Terrace. They have been building on the Terrace, improving the stage and completing other structural additions. It just reopened and we are looking forward to a warm Spring evening with our backs to Lake Monona.
