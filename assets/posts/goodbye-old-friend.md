It is with sorrow in my heart that I tell you that our banjo player, Jim Robarts, has passed. The last 2 years he has battled the re-occurence of his Vietnam War related cancer. This year we completed a new CD and he played gigs through the summer. He Passed peacefully in hospice 10/26/23. His smile and 5 string playing will remain in our memories for years to come. Goodbye old friend. BB
