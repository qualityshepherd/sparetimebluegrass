### MP3 Samples

[Rising Waters](http://www.sparetimebluegrass.com/documents/Track3.mp3) (Robarts) Jim lives on a continuously rising lake. He wrote this tune while contemplating four inches of water on his porch.

[Tell Me Something](http://www.sparetimebluegrass.com/documents/Track2.mp3) (Kreitzer) Mark Kreitzer is a multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter from the Twin Cities. He is a good friend of ours and plumbs the depths of relationships in his music.

[99 Years](http://www.sparetimebluegrass.com/documents/Track1.mp3) (Anderson) Like trains, prisons pop up like mushrooms in bluegrass. Scott found this in the “Whispering” Bill Anderson song bag.
